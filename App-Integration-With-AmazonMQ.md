# AWS Application Integration Services
## Step Functions  
- AWS Step Functions is a serverless function orchestrator that makes it easy to sequence AWS Lambda functions and multiple AWS services into business-critical applications. 
- Through its visual interface, you can create and run a series of checkpointed and event-driven workflows that maintain the application state.
## Amazon AppFlow 
- Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that lets you securely transfer data between Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications and AWS services. 
- Use Amazon AppFlow to automate your data transfers in just a few minutes. No coding is required.
## Amazon EventBridge
- Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easier to build event-driven applications at scale using events 
- generated from your applications, integrated Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services.
## Amazon MQ
- Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers in the cloud, 
- so you can migrate your messaging and applications without rewriting code.
## Simple Notification Service
- Pub/sub messaging for microservices and serverless applications.
- Amazon SNS is a highly available, durable, secure, fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices,
- distributed systems, and event-driven serverless applications. Amazon SNS provides topics for high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging.
## Simple Queue Service
- A message queuing service
- Amazon SQS provides queues for high-throughput, system-to-system messaging. You can use queues to decouple heavyweight processes and to buffer and batch work. 
- Amazon SQS stores messages until microservices and serverless applications process them.
## SWF
-   Amazon Simple Workflow Service 
-   Amazon SWF helps developers build, run, and scale background jobs that have parallel or sequential steps. 
-   You can think of Amazon SWF as a fully-managed state tracker and task coordinator in the Cloud.
