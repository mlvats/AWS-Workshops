# DECOUPLED MICROSERVICES

-  Using REST APIs for communications between a set of systems can decouple them to a certain degree,
-  REST APIs tend to be designed with synchronous communications
-  However, there is another option that provides even looser coupling: asynchronous messaging.
- Asynchronous messaging is a fundamental approach for integrating independent systems, or building up a set of loosely coupled systems that can operate, scale, and evolve independently and flexibly.
