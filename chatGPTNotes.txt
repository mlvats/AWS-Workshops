write data load strategy in batch and calling an API to get surrogate key
Here is a general outline of a data load strategy that uses batch processing and calls an API to obtain a surrogate key:

Data Extraction: The first step is to extract the data from the source system(s). This could be from a database, a file system, or any other source.
Data Transformation: The extracted data is then transformed to meet the requirements of the target system. This could include cleaning, transforming data types, adding or removing columns, and so on.
Data Validation: After the data has been transformed, it should be validated to ensure that it meets the data quality standards and constraints of the target system.
API Call for Surrogate Key: To obtain a surrogate key, the data load process would make an API call to a separate system that is responsible for generating unique keys. This system would return a unique key for each record in the data set.
Data Loading: The transformed and validated data, along with the surrogate key, can then be loaded into the target system. This could be done in batch, meaning that the data is loaded in a batch-by-batch fashion, or it could be done in real-time, meaning that the data is loaded as soon as it is available.
Data Validation: After the data has been loaded, it should be validated again to ensure that it has been loaded correctly and that the surrogate key has been properly applied.
Data Monitoring: Finally, the data should be monitored over time to ensure that it continues to meet the data quality standards and constraints of the target system. This may involve running periodic data validation and reconciliation processes.
This data load strategy is a common approach for batch processing and can be tailored to meet the specific requirements of each project. The key is to ensure that the data is transformed and validated appropriately, and that a unique identifier, such as a surrogate key, is applied to each record in the data set.

I am passing primary key of data in a batch of 500 records to an API to get surrogate key, how to map back primary key with the data in a batch flow
To map the primary key back to the data in a batch flow, you can use a unique identifier, such as a hash value, to associate the primary key with the corresponding record in the data batch. Here's an outline of the process:

Hash Generation: Generate a unique hash value for each primary key in the batch of 500 records. You can use a cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256, to generate a unique hash value for each primary key.
API Call: Pass the hash values along with the primary keys in the batch to the API that generates the surrogate key. The API should return a response that includes both the hash value and the corresponding surrogate key for each record in the batch.
Map Primary Key to Data: After receiving the response from the API, use the hash value to associate the primary key with the corresponding record in the data batch. The hash value can be used as a lookup key to map the primary key back to the data.
Load Data: Load the data, along with the surrogate key, into the target system. To ensure that the primary key can be mapped back to the data in the future, it is important to persist the hash value along with the data in the target system.
By using a unique identifier, such as a hash value, to associate the primary key with the data, you can ensure that the primary key can be mapped back to the data in a batch flow. Additionally, by storing the hash value along with the data, you can maintain a permanent mapping between the primary key and the data, even if the primary key or the data changes in the future.

best practices for making API call to get surrogate key in a batch process
Here are some best practices for making API calls to obtain surrogate keys in a batch processing scenario:

Batch Size: Determine the optimal batch size for making API calls. Too large a batch size may result in timeouts or error responses, while too small a batch size may increase the number of API calls and impact performance.
Error Handling: Implement error handling and retry logic to ensure that failed API calls are retried in a controlled manner. This may involve setting retry limits, exponential backoff algorithms, and logging failed requests for later analysis.
Throttling: Implement rate limiting or throttling mechanisms to control the rate at which API calls are made. This can help prevent overloading the API and ensure that the API is used in a responsible manner.
Caching: Consider implementing caching mechanisms to store the surrogate key-primary key mapping so that the API does not need to be called for every record in the batch. This can significantly improve performance and reduce the load on the API.
Monitoring: Monitor the API calls and their responses to ensure that the API is being used as expected and to identify any issues or errors that may be occurring. This may involve logging API requests and responses, monitoring API response times, and tracking the number of API calls made per unit of time.
Load Balancing: Consider load balancing the API calls across multiple instances or nodes to ensure that the API is used in a scalable and highly available manner.
By following these best practices, you can make API calls to obtain surrogate keys in a batch processing scenario in a reliable, efficient, and scalable manner.

what JIRA stories I need to do the of software development for making API call to get surrogate key in a batch process
Here are some JIRA stories that can be used to plan the software development work for making API calls to obtain surrogate keys in a batch process:

Define API requirements: Define the requirements for the API that will generate the surrogate keys. This may include the API endpoint, request and response formats, authentication mechanisms, and error handling requirements.
Batch processing logic: Develop the logic for batch processing the primary keys and making API calls to obtain the corresponding surrogate keys. This may involve defining the batch size, error handling, and retry mechanisms, as well as the mapping of the surrogate keys back to the primary keys.
Caching mechanism: Implement a caching mechanism to store the surrogate key-primary key mapping so that the API does not need to be called for every record in the batch. This may involve defining the cache expiration logic, cache eviction strategies, and cache invalidation mechanisms.
Monitoring and Logging: Implement monitoring and logging mechanisms to track the API calls, responses, and performance. This may involve logging API requests and responses, monitoring API response times, and tracking the number of API calls made per unit of time.
Load balancing: Develop load balancing mechanisms to ensure that the API calls are made in a scalable and highly available manner. This may involve implementing load balancing algorithms, failover mechanisms, and load testing strategies.
Error Handling: Implement error handling and retry logic to ensure that failed API calls are retried in a controlled manner. This may involve setting retry limits, exponential backoff algorithms, and logging failed requests for later analysis.
Test and Deploy: Test the implementation of the batch processing logic, caching mechanism, monitoring and logging, and error handling, and deploy the solution in a production environment.
By breaking down the software development work into these JIRA stories, you can ensure that all of the necessary components for making API calls to obtain surrogate keys in a batch process are developed and tested.

I am loading data into a database and just before loading I have to call an API to populate surrogate key in batch data loading
Here are the steps you can follow to populate the surrogate key in the batch data before loading it into the database:

Extract the data: Extract the data from its source and store it in a temporary location, such as a file or a staging table.
Prepare the batch data: Prepare the batch data by dividing it into smaller chunks, based on the size of the batch. You should determine the optimal batch size based on the API's rate limits and response time.
Call the API: For each batch, call the API to obtain the surrogate keys. You should pass the primary keys of the data in the batch as part of the API request.
Map the surrogate keys: Map the surrogate keys returned by the API back to the primary keys in the batch data. This may involve storing the mapping in a temporary location or updating the batch data directly.
Load the data: Load the batch data with the surrogate keys into the database. You should implement error handling and retry logic to ensure that any errors encountered during the loading process are captured and handled appropriately.
Monitor the process: Monitor the process of loading the data, including the API calls and their responses, to ensure that the process is working as expected. You should also log any errors or exceptions that occur during the process to aid in debugging and performance analysis.
By following these steps, you can populate the surrogate key in the batch data before loading it into the database, ensuring that the data is loaded with the correct identifier.

we want to write primary key for which API does not have surrogate key to an AWS SQS, please describe the flow
Here is the high-level flow for writing the primary keys for which the API does not have a corresponding surrogate key to an AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue:

Extract the data: Extract the data from its source and store it in a temporary location, such as a file or a staging table.
Prepare the batch data: Prepare the batch data by dividing it into smaller chunks, based on the size of the batch.
Call the API: For each batch, call the API to obtain the surrogate keys. You should pass the primary keys of the data in the batch as part of the API request.
Filter the keys: Filter the primary keys for which the API does not return a corresponding surrogate key.
Write to SQS: Write the filtered primary keys to an SQS queue. You should serialize the primary keys into a format that can be stored in the queue, such as JSON or XML.
Monitor the queue: Monitor the SQS queue to ensure that the primary keys are being written to it as expected. You should log any errors or exceptions that occur during the process to aid in debugging and performance analysis.
Process the queue: Develop a separate process to periodically retrieve the primary keys from the SQS queue and perform any necessary actions, such as logging the missing keys or retrying the API call.
By following this flow, you can write the primary keys for which the API does not have a corresponding surrogate key to an SQS queue, providing a mechanism for processing these keys in a separate process. This can help ensure that the data loading process is not impacted by the absence of surrogate keys for a small number of records.
